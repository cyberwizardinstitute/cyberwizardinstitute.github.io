Welcome friends.
</p>
<p>
Cyber Wizard Institute is an open, collaborative, and free
programming school based out of the <a
href="http://sudoroom.org">Sudo
Room</a> hackerspace in <a href="http://oaklandwiki.org">Oakland, CA</a>.</p>

<p>
We ran two sessions of Cyber Wizard in 2015. One session
was a month long, on weekdays, from 12PM-6PM. The second
session was two weeks long, at night on weekdays and during
the day on weekends (because it was only two weeks, we met
every day).
</p>

<p>
As of summer 2016, there are no future sessions planned.
However, we have provided all of our materials for anyone
who would like to learn and for anyone who is interested in
running their own Cyber Wizard sessions.
