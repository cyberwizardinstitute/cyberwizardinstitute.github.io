<p>
Welcome friends. Come, learn how to be a
cyberwizard with us.
</p>
<p>
We're an open, collaborative, and free
programming school based out of the <a
href="http://sudoroom.org">Sudo
Room</a> hackerspace in <a href="http://oaklandwiki.org">Oakland</a>.</p>

<p>
The idea is to be an anti-bootcamp. Anyone
can participate. It's free.
We're going to try hard to have lecture
notes, assignments, and lecture
livestreams up online. It will be
primarily self-directed, but with guidance from higher
level wizards.
</p>

<h1>Schools of Magic</h1><img src="wand.gif">

<p>
We'll be covering all of the elements
that a novice cyberwizard might want to be
familiar with in order to alter space
and time... <i>cyber</i>-space and time.

</p>
<ul>
    <li>unix command line with bash
    <li>javascript
    <li>computer science fundamentals
    <li>programming languages (regex,
    state machines, parsing)
    <li>node.js (back-end programming)
    <li>front-end programming
    <li>collaboration (git & github,
    documentation, testing, open source)


</ul>

<p>
The Institute will run from August 1-15,
2015, at <a
href="http://sudoroom.org">Sudo
Room</a>. You can spend as much or as
little time at Sudo as you want (and are
encouraged to interact with others at
the space), but facilitators will be at
the space on weekdays, helping
answer questions and giving talks. 
 Facilitators will also bring in guests
to present.</p>
<p> "Homework" will
consist of <a
href="http://nodeschool.io">Node
School</a> assignments, but
we'll encourage you to pick a project
(or multiple projects) as well. It's ok
if you already know what you want to
work on and it's ok if you don't. We'll
help you explore the different areas of
programming.</p>
<p> We'll also have a weekly
show-and-tell that will be open to other
Sudoers where we'll share what we
learned and worked on that week. This
will be low-stress and for the purpose
of getting feedback on our work, helping
get through difficult spots, and sharing
tricks you learn.

<h1>Requirements</h1>
<img src="sparkles.gif" border="0"/>

<p>
You need to have your own computer. It
doesn't have to be a very powerful
computer, but you need one.
</p>
<p>
Your computer should run either Linux or
a Mac OS. If you have Windows, we will
help you install Linux - but you have to
be willing to have Linux!
</p>
<p>
The Institute is free. <a href="https://gratipay.com/sudoroom/">We welcome your contributions</a>,
but there is no fee associated.
</p>

<h1>Who is this for? </h1>

<img src="doge.jpg" width=240 height=141>

<p>
This is for anyone who wants to learn
cyberwizardry! 
You should have basic computer
skills and feel comfortable finding
information on the internet. 
Folks from communities
that have historically been excluded
from tech are very much encouraged to
apply! 
</p>
<p>
Please note that this isn't like a
bootcamp or like school. We won't talk
at you for the entire time and try to
fill your brain with knowledge. We will
try to give you the spells and advice
that will help you become an awesome
learner and programming problem-solver.
The Institute is primarily driven by
you and your peers.
</p>
<p>
If you're not sure whether you qualify or if you
should apply, <a href="mailto:marina.kukso@gmail.com">contact us</a> and we'll
promptly reply.
